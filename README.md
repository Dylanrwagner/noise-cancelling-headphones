# noise-cancelling-headphones
Noise cancelling headphone software for school project. Work in progress.

# Running
Assumes default audio input is the headphone microphone and default audio input is the headphone speakers. Also requires an additional microphone inside the headphones with which to calculate the amplitude of the noise coming in; this microphone is only used for the first second of running, so it can be removed when "calibrating... done" is printed.

# Issues
Still a work in progress. Does not yet function. In theory, it will still have problems once completed, requiring re-calibration if the noise level changes significantly at any time.
